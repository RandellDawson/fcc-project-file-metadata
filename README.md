# File Metadata Microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. 

Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

HINT: You can use the multer npm package to handle file uploading.

## User Stories/Tests
- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
- The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.
- When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
